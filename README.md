# Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

The problem i'm solving is being a centralised gym trainer app, that incooperates many gyms and different trainers. The problem for users to find and acquire a service is that information is dispersed and makes things confusing for users for where to train or who with and empowers trainers to more choice for there business, outside the domains of the gym they work at.


# Why is it a problem that needs solving?

 Since there is no collective location of advertising trainers in our community instead of having a small trainers section on a website or flyer on the wall.

 It enables users lower time searching multiple site or facing tedious interactions being sold a product instead of them buying it. Finally it sets precedent of quality in health industry and trainers.
